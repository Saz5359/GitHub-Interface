# GitHub Interface

This project is a full-stack web application that interfaces with the most popular VCS provider the GitHub API.

Frontend here - https://github.com/Saz5359/GitHub-Interface-Frontend

## Motivation

After learning Express, Restful APIs, the Fetch API, React, and JavaScript from my bootcamp it was time to use everything I've learned to create an app. I learned about a good app that can be made using all of this and that was one that used the GitHub API and as an extra challenge, I have listed the last 5 commitsâ€™ descriptions of each repo.

#### App is live here https://github-interface.onrender.com/
